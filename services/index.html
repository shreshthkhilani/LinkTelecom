    <h3>Brand Management</h3>
    <div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 messagetext" align="left">
      <br>
      <strong>How do you position a brand in the 21st century?</strong>
      <br>
      <strong>Should your products be expensive or cheap?</strong>
      <br>
      <strong>Is hiring a celebrity worth the money?</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      These are few of the basic questions that most brands have to ask themselves all the time. Unfortunately, most answers are not simply black and white, but working with Link Telecom can give you a lot of the clarity you seek.
      <br><br>
      Our extensive market research can give your company a well-founded idea of which products work and which don’t.
      <br><br>
      Some of the brands we work with, target large chunks of the volume segment while others are entirely focused on the value segment. Positioning yourself is critical in your appeal to both the consumer and the retailer. At Link Telecom we can guide you through this process and give you all the information you need in order to develop and market a strong brand with superior products.
      <br><br>
      A few of our clients, lean on our reputation to create and develop their brand while others use their strong pull power to further grow and enter territories they had not explored before. No matter what your brand is, we have a myriad of solutions for you at our disposal.

    <h3>Market Development</h3>
    <div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 valuestext" align="left">
      <br>
      Market development is an art, which has to be honed and refined. At Link Telecom, we are proud to say that we have repeated this to a point of perfection.
      <br><br>
      In 2002, we became city distributors in Kolkata for Nokia. Through this business we successfully created the platform for telecom in this city. We rapidly expanded our width of distribution and nurtured several of the largest retailers in the city. 
      <br><br>
      In 2008, we moved from city distributors to national distributors selling both Samsung phones and HP laptops across East India. Samsung at that point was not yet a major player, but we were able to successfully replicate our success with Nokia and apply it in on a large scale. Soon we were dealing with 2 products that were market leaders in their respective segments.
      <br><br>
      Today, Link telecom, is working with several major brands which are all uniquely positioned in different product categories.

    <h3>Value Creation</h3>
    <div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 valuestext" align="left">
      <br>
      Value creation is pivotal for all members of the supply chain right from the manufacturer to the consumer to gain a perceived value from a product.
      <br><br>
      At Link Telecom, we maintain an information flow from the consumer to the principal. This allows principals to hear all feedback on every single scheme, policy and product right from the ground. Furthermore, we always do an honest and accurate scheme payout for our distributor partners and our retailers. Every single time.
      <br><br>
      It is a combination of a plethora of activities that allows us to preserve the supply chain ecosystem to ensure that every single component is happy and performing up to the optimal level.
